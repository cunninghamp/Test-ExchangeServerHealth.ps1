# Test-ExchangeServerHealth.ps1
PowerShell script to generate a report of the health of an Exchange Server 2010/2013 environment.

Performs a series of health checks on Exchange servers and DAGs and outputs the results to screen, and optionally to log file, HTML report, and HTML email.

## Usage

Create an ignorelist.txt file in the same folder as the script to specify any servers, DAGs, or databases you want the script to ignore (eg test/dev servers).

Modify the SMTP settings in the script to send emails to your own address:

```
#...................................
# Modify these Email Settings
#...................................

$smtpsettings = @{
	To =  "administrator@exchangeserverpro.net"
	From = "exchangeserver@exchangeserverpro.net"
	Subject = "$reportemailsubject - $now"
	SmtpServer = "smtp.exchangeserverpro.net"
	}
```

When running the script on non-English servers you can modify the following variables in the script to match your language so that the script does not give errors or incorrect results.

```
#...................................
# Modify these language 
# localization strings.
#...................................

# The server roles must match the role names you see when you run Test-ServiceHealth.
$casrole = "Client Access Server Role"
$htrole = "Hub Transport Server Role"
$mbrole = "Mailbox Server Role"
$umrole = "Unified Messaging Server Role"

# This should match the word for "Success", or the result of a successful Test-MAPIConnectivity test
$success = "Success"
```

For example, a German system would use the following values:

```
# The server roles must match the role names you see when you run Test-ServiceHealth.
$casrole = "Clientzugriffs-Serverrolle"
$htrole = "Hub-Transport-Serverrolle"
$mbrole = "Postfachserverrolle"
$umrole = "Unified Messaging-Serverrolle"

# This should match the word for "Success", or the result of a successful Test-MAPIConnectivity test
$success = "Erfolgreich"
```

## Parameters

- **-Server**, Perform a health check of a single server
- **-ReportMode**, Set to $true to generate a HTML report. A default file name is used if none is specified.
- **-ReportFile**, Allows you to specify a different HTML report file name than the default.
- **-SendEmail**, Sends the HTML report via email using the SMTP configuration within the script.
- **-AlertsOnly**, Only sends the email report if at least one error or warning was detected.
- **-Log**, Writes a log file to help with troubleshooting.
